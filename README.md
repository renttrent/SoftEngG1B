# Project description

Running a successful fitness business is very demanding and a difficult task given the competitive market. Having a great internal management system for keeping track of business related tasks or services and having attractive features that elevate customer satisfaction can help quite a bit inside this market. This application aims to solve these problems for a specific fitness business in Elbasan.

Almost no other business in this field has a real product that solves the problems mentioned above, that is why we think this can bring big potential value to the business and could help reduce business costs since it aims to save time for staff and customers. This business has an average of 320 memberships and is planning to expand in 2 more locations, which makes our solution a much more attractive option.
