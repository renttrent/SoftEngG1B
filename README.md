# Project description

This application is aimed to solve problems related to a fitness business in Elbasan. The app will help users track their Gym activity and monitor their progress similar to a workout digital journal with extra features related to the business. Managers and Trainers will be able to use the application to add content to the website or get useful data from it. Trainers can create Exercises and Routines for specific users which will be accessible to the user in the application. The exercise will contain the description, number of reps, possible calories burned and a video link that shows in depth how the exercise is done.
This specific business also has Diet Plans that they offer to customers for weight gain/loss. We plan on including viewing these diet plans and letting the user buy them from the website. Another important feature of the app is the Events window that will show the latest and upcoming events in the gym.
